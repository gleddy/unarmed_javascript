	<h3>Multimedia</h3>
	<p>Where possible, for web-based multimedia, the ideal solution is to incorporate sign language interpretation with the video as picture-in-picture, as this provides a synchronized presentation. However, this can be a very time consuming and costly process. And as sign language is specific to certain regions, it will be more appropriate in some situations than others. As an alternative, sign language interpreting can be recorded and provided in addition to the audio and transcript or captioning.</p>
	<p>Alternately, a combination of captioning (to transcribe sound effects) and subtitling (written translation, with a focus on users with sign as a primary language) is most effective. Where this isn't possible, a transcript of the dialogue will suffice; transcripts provide the user with an opportunity to print out the dialogue and read it at a comfortable pace.</p>
	<p>Remember that the purpose of subtitling is to convey meaning, not to test the language skills of the audience. It is more important to convey the meaning and sentiment of audio content than to transcribe it verbatim.</p>
